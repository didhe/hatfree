Advice from somewhere, someone
</h1>

<p>
I do not, customarily, consider advice provided. As a statement of what is right and good, advice must rightly emerge from a framework of what is right and good. Within such a model, the very best advice—that advice which is always right—is tautology; a piece of advice which adheres to a system of values which has already been accepted <em>cannot</em> have been provided, because it already was, inherent to those values. This sort of advice was already knewn; one simply hadn’t been practicing it to as full an extent—receiving the advice was perhaps helpful, but more in the way of nagging reminder than profound revelation.
</p>
<p>
I cannot say much for profound revelations—possibly, but not necessarily, because I haven’t achieved any, or perhaps because I don’t remember and recognise any. Still, it is so apocalyptic advice, if to a lesser extent, which might be considered advice which <em>can</em> be provided: advice which is <em>not</em> in every case in accord with one’s priors. Advice which is <em>provided</em> must be advice which introduces a new aspect into (or overturns altogether, though mere advice which does this much seems rare) one’s judgment of what is good and right.
</p>
<p>
Now, if a certain Stephen Crane of the nineteenth century happens to have written, and published in a collection (<em>War is Kind and, and Other Lines</em>) a brief poem, reproduced below:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A man said to the universe:  “Sir I exist!”  “However,” replied the universe,  “The fact has not created in me  ”A sense of obligation.“
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
—then, shall we say that this advice, or at least the sentiment, was provided to me Stephen Crane himself?
</p>
<p>
There are at least three quite distinct elements in this story, which are to great extent separated in continuity but united by an overarching theme.
</p>
<p>
Of the formers, one first intersects with our third fully three years ago, with a contemporary schoolteacher’s and its declaration. The former is Thomas Jacobs, and the latter is, variously, “I don’t care how you feel,” “I don’t care about your feelings,” “I don’t care about student [<em>sic</em>].” (This latter has been accompanied by “I care about students,” which tends to be contextually the implication of the the formers as well.)
</p>
<p>
A second is an introduction to the Stephen Crane cited above, in the form of handout distributed by Marissa Smith, closer to two years ago, a piece of American literature.
</p>
<p>
A third comes as parts of the closing lines of two different translations of Albert Camus’ <em>L’Étranger</em> (<em>The Stranger</em>), the Matthew Ward and the Stuart Gilbert, distributed by the same, as the same piece of world literature. Respectively, they read:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As if the blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Shall we consider this three items of advice? Or shall we, rather, consider this a single item of advice—and then, which did it come from—if any?
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a better question would ask whether this is good advice.
</p>
<p>
I consider this in whole to be a single item of good advice. That is to say, this sentiment, conveyed to me by three paths, contributes to a single whole which agrees in large part with my definition of value, of what is right and what is good. It has been, or it has become, or it has been incorporated into, a defining element of my <em>Weltanschauung</em>.
</p>
<p>
I would not say it has done me any favours in suggesting courses of action; perhaps even very much the opposite. But it has provided me with a framework in which to accomodate reality. An uncaring world of uncaring others driven by uncaring phenomena is a world with plenty of room for pleasant things. It is a pleasantly simple world of itself.

It matters just as much

<p>
The lack of permanence in the world, at least, is difficult to dispute. There are no counterexamples; <em>this universe itself</em> seems opposed to the notion, given that the laws of thermodynamics seem to guarantee an end state at equilibrium,<sup><a href="./posts/2013-10-04-it-matters-just-as-much.html#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> the past unascertainable—true permanence in this world is essentially restricted to unit.
</p>
<p>
Permanence as a concept is eminently conceivable and deeply attractive; yet no amount of human effort can achieve it. Perhaps it is natural, then, that our literature and mythology so often place it strictly under the purview of the divine, or at least mystical. This is as much true in the <em>Gilgamesh</em> as in classical and Abrahamic mythologies: eternal, permanent life is granted to Utnapishtim and his wife only by the grace of the god Enlil; the secret plant which restores youth is a mystery of the gods; man is allotted death, but life remains in the gods’ own keeping.
</p>
<p>
Yet in <em>this</em> world, there does not appear to be permanence, even from the gods, so it might follow that there is, ultimately, no meaning in anything—if all will end in time in uniform insignificance anyway.
</p>
<p>
Still, people <em>do</em> “get up and go about their business”. If there is no meaning, must there not be at least some driving force, some reason to continue?
</p>
<p>
Some, perhaps, have never truly believed in the fundamental impermanence of the world. Afterlives, after all—particularly those in which one’s lot is determined by judgment of one’s actions in life—are a recurring theme in the world’s mythologies. By introducing an independent measure of meaning, the transience of <em>this</em> life becomes irrelevant: it matters just as much as the <em>next</em> life matters. Whether in a system of reincarnation, as in the dharmic tradition, or of eternal afterlives, as in the Abrahamic tradition, the work of the present life is in anticipation of the life yet to come.
</p>
<p>
But for the others—even if for no other reason, even if there truly is not meaning to life, people do and will continue for a long time to get up and act. The tyranny of natural selection assures it, because impermanence means, in the end, everyone dies.
</p>
<p>
Even if impermanence makes everything hold no meaning, action is no less meaningful than inaction, and no action any more or less than any other. So, perhaps, when everyone is dead, some may have left offspring—offspring which, as in any other sustainable self-replicating system, have derived their traits from their parents, and thus have likely inherited some tendency to produce offspring. Once the initial generations have died off, only the offspring remain; those which could not (or would not) reproduce become lost forever to the impermanence of the world.
</p>
<p>
Thus, even if the amount of meaning is exactly the same, whether or not we act, there should be, in all possible worlds, far fewer people who do go on with their lives than who do not. Since our ability to observe the world is predicated on our presence in it, there is consequently an anthropic bias favouring a world in which most humans actually do get out of bed in the morning.
</p>
<p>
Still, we all will die. We will have mattered.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Eventually, we will not matter; just as we ourselves cannot achieve permanence, neither can our influence: as time goes on, we are forgotten, and our actions become inconsequential.
</p>
<p>
But as impermanent as they are, the actions have a <em>persistence</em> without well-defined limit. The effects of self-replication in particular, for example, extend indefinitely and are <em>distinctly inherent</em> to all life: even if they are not meaningful, they at least remain; each individual has been born to a lineage which, in every generation, reproduced.
</p>
<p>
The <em>sole motive</em> (if it can be called that) life has or needs is its own propagation. Life may not have a meaning, but neither does it need one: most of us will get up in the morning and go about our business anyway.
</p>
<p>
Some won’t. It matters just as much.
