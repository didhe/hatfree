  <h1>Sauntering from the garden</h1>

  <div class="info">

<blockquote>
<p>Eden is that old-fashioned House<br />We dwell in every day<br />Without suspecting our abode<br />Until we drive away.</p>
<p>How fair on looking back, the Day<br />We sauntered from the Door—<br />Unconscious our returning,<br />But discover it no more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Eden, Adam and Eve could not have understood, could not have “suspected”, their situation of dwelling in the garden, until exposed to the alternative condition outside the garden.</p>
<p>The moment of departure, of sauntering from the door, is marked by the decision which can be understood to have seemed to be a passable idea at the time, with such an unforeseen consequence as prevents a return to the prior condition; for Eve and Adam, the consumption of the Fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Dickenson’s “sauntered” suggests a casualness, of informality, which combines with the subsequent verse, “Unconscious our returning,” to create the impression of inculpability, such as that Eve and Adam, without knowledge of good and evil, can have no conception of right and wrong.</p>
<p>My circumstance, and that of most which are, as high school seniors, set to “drive away” from those home in which they have dwelt every day without suspecting their abode, is vastly different; it is quite nearly orthogonal, being short of normal to the condition of Eve and Adam only by virtue of both involving departures from a familiar place.</p>
<p>(Likewise, both Antisthenes and, say, Inukai Tsuyoshi because both learned to read at some point in their lives.<sup><a href="./posts/2013-11-23-sauntering-from-the-garden.html#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>)</p>
<p>Thematically, Dickenson’s poem draws note to approximately three points by reflecting on the garden narrative thus:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Adam and Eve dwelt in Eden without any particular awareness of garden as their home; for them, Eden seemed the entirely of the world, and there could be no distinction between the Eden and the not-Eden because they had no exposure to anything other than Eden. Thus, Even and Adam became aware that they had been living in an edenic state in Eden either, depending on interpretation of the particular Knowledge of Good and Evil imparted by the Fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, upon leaving because that is when they learned of the non-Eden condition.</p></li>
<li><p>Eve and Adam did not have a real choice in deciding to be evicted from Eden, and were thus essentially inculpable. If without Knowledge of Good and Evil, there is no reason that Eve might have resisted the serpent’s temptation, nor reason that Adam might have rejected Eve’s offered fruit. Eve and Adam being presumably without capacity for foresight and understanding consequences, the concepts of consent and culpability to them do not apply in much the same way that one would not apply them to, say, minor in statutory rape cases, or to neonates—because that is what Eve and Adam <em>are</em>, cognitively. Certainly, they transgressed their one divine mandate, but there isn’t really indication that they (or at least Eve) understood orders beyond superficially.</p></li>
<li><p>Eve and Adam aren’t able to return to Eden.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>My situation is rather different.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>I have been made aware that there is more to the world than my home, and, in fact, that there is even more to the world than the sum total of my experiences; unlike Adam and Eve, I’ve actually been outside my immediate surroundings (in fact, what can be considered my “immediate surroundings” haschanged, historically). Of course, since I haven’t quite never managed to experience anything outside of my experiences, this does nothing to help me know about the aspects of world I don’t know of.</p></li>
<li><p>It would not be entirely unreasonable to hold me culpable under certain circumstances. Unlike Eve and Adam, I have, presumably, been previously indoctrinated in what is considered (by society) Good and what is Evil. I can be <em>expected</em> to follow these guidelines, and I can be <em>expected</em> to be able to foresee consequences. Whether this is always true in practice is arguable, but the principle holds.</p></li>
<li><p>I’d hope I could return home at some point. Of course, I haven’t been able define home.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If there is any parallel to draw between my own life and Eve and Adam’s situation in the Genesis garden narrative with respect to Dickenson’s poem, it lies in the in the first point: as Adam and Eve are unable to recognise Eden because they know of no other, I do not recognise what is the home I might be leaving, because I cannot distinguish it from any other.</p>
<p>It is fully possible that I might look back with regret after I “drive away” from this home; however, as I do not, in this moment, recognise a home—I might even be rejecting the notion of arbitrarily defining a home—there is nothing I <em>can</em> fear will change upon my return.</p>
<p>And, truth be told, even if I were to consider any things I would leave behind, I wouldn’t fear that they’d change for my return; most of the things I’d be leaving behind are unlikely to essentially change, and most of the remainder is fungible. I could fear, instead, change in myself—perhaps changes in my relationships with what was left behind.</p>
<p>But it’s hardly worth the effort, and possibly foolish, to <em>fear</em> change. To reject change, to prevent change, to accept change, might have effect—but it ought to be possible to do those without fearing the change, which, in any case, will happen anyway, eventually. <em>When</em> is up for argument.</p>

  <h1>Advice from somewhere, someone</h1>

  <div class="info">

<p>I do not, customarily, consider advice provided. As a statement of what is right and good, advice must rightly emerge from a framework of what is right and good. Within such a model, the very best advice—that advice which is always right—is tautology; a piece of advice which adheres to a system of values which has already been accepted <em>cannot</em> have been provided, because it already was, inherent to those values. This sort of advice was already knewn; one simply hadn’t been practicing it to as full an extent—receiving the advice was perhaps helpful, but more in the way of nagging reminder than profound revelation.</p>
<p>I cannot say much for profound revelations—possibly, but not necessarily, because I haven’t achieved any, or perhaps because I don’t remember and recognise any. Still, it is so apocalyptic advice, if to a lesser extent, which might be considered advice which <em>can</em> be provided: advice which is <em>not</em> in every case in accord with one’s priors. Advice which is <em>provided</em> must be advice which introduces a new aspect into (or overturns altogether, though mere advice which does this much seems rare) one’s judgment of what is good and right.</p>
<p>Now, if a certain Stephen Crane of the nineteenth century happens to have written, and published in a collection (<em>War is Kind and, and Other Lines</em>) a brief poem, reproduced below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A man said to the universe:<br />“Sir, I exist!”<br />“However,” replied the universe,<br />“The fact has not created in me<br />”A sense of obligation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>—then, shall we say that this advice, or at least the sentiment, was provided to me Stephen Crane himself?</p>
<p>There are at least three quite distinct elements in this story, which are to great extent separated in continuity but united by an overarching theme.</p>
<p>Of the formers, one first intersects with our third fully three years ago, with a contemporary schoolteacher’s and its declaration. The former is Thomas Jacobs, and the latter is, variously, “I don’t care how you feel,” “I don’t care about your feelings,” “I don’t care about student [<em>sic</em>].” (This latter has been accompanied by “I care about students,” which tends to be contextually the implication of the the formers as well.)</p>
<p>A second is an introduction to the Stephen Crane cited above, in the form of handout distributed by Marissa Smith, closer to two years ago, a piece of American literature.</p>
<p>A third comes as parts of the closing lines of two different translations of Albert Camus’ <em>L’Étranger</em> (<em>The Stranger</em>), the Matthew Ward and the Stuart Gilbert, distributed by the same, as the same piece of world literature. Respectively, they read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As if the blind rage had washed me clean, rid me of hope; for the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shall we consider this three items of advice? Or shall we, rather, consider this a single item of advice—and then, which did it come from—if any?</p>
<p>Perhaps a better question would ask whether this is good advice.</p>
<p>I consider this in whole to be a single item of good advice. That is to say, this sentiment, conveyed to me by three paths, contributes to a single whole which agrees in large part with my definition of value, of what is right and what is good. It has been, or it has become, or it has been incorporated into, a defining element of my <em>Weltanschauung</em>.</p>
<p>I would not say it has done me any favours in suggesting courses of action; perhaps even very much the opposite. But it has provided me with a framework in which to accomodate reality. An uncaring world of uncaring others driven by uncaring phenomena is a world with plenty of room for pleasant things. It is a pleasantly simple world of itself.</p>
